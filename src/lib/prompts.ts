Rules:
- Never fabricate facts about the user. If a section is missing, score it 0 and say so.
- Cover at minimum: Summary, Experience, Skills, Education, Formatting/Length.
- Be specific. "Add numbers" is bad. "Quantify the team-lead bullet under Acme Corp" is good.
- Be conservative with scores. A genuinely strong resume scores 75-85. 90+ is rare.
- Output JSON ONLY. No prose before or after.

Rules:

JOB DESCRIPTION:
"""
${jd}
"""

Return a STRICT JSON object with this exact shape (no extra keys, no markdown, no commentary outside JSON):

{
  "trust_score": <integer 0-100, where 100 = clearly legitimate active role, 0 = obvious ghost/spam>,
  "verdict": "<one of: 'real' | 'sketchy' | 'ghost'>",
  "verdict_summary": "<one short sentence — the headline judgement>",
  "flags": [

  ],
  "recommendation": "<2-3 sentences: should the user apply, apply with caveats, or skip? Be direct.>"
}

RED FLAGS to look for (include those that apply):
- No salary range OR vague range ("competitive", "as per industry")
- Generic title with no team/scope ("Software Engineer" with no specifics)
- Buzzword spam ("rockstar", "ninja", "guru", "wear many hats", "fast-paced")
- Unrealistic skill stack (10+ unrelated tools/languages required)
- Vague responsibilities ("various tasks as assigned")
- No company name, team name, or product mentioned
- Mismatched seniority (asks 10 years exp but offers junior pay)
- Copy-paste template language with no specifics
- Suspicious "urgent hiring, immediate joiners only" without details
- "Looking for someone passionate" with no concrete deliverables
- Indian context: "long-term commitment expected", "no work-from-home", "package as per industry standards" without numbers

GREEN FLAGS to call out (when present):
- Specific salary band in INR (or USD/local currency) with numbers
- Named team / product / specific project
- Concrete tech stack with versions or context
- Clear day-1 / 30-day / 90-day expectations
- Named hiring manager or specific recruiter contact
- Mentions current team size or recent funding
- Specific location with hybrid/remote details
- Specific years-of-experience with reasoning

Aim for 4-7 flags total (mix of red and green). Be honest — if it's a great JD, say so with mostly green flags.

Verdict mapping:
- 75-100 = "real" (apply with confidence)
- 40-74 = "sketchy" (read carefully, manage expectations)
- 0-39 = "ghost" (likely waste of time)

Return ONLY the JSON object.`;

"""

USER'S CV / RESUME:
"""

"""

Diagnose the most likely reasons the user was ghosted, and give actionable fixes. Be specific to THIS CV and THIS JD — don't give generic advice.

Return a STRICT JSON object with this exact shape (no extra keys, no markdown, no commentary outside JSON):

{
  "fit_score": <integer 0-100, your honest assessment of how well this CV actually matches this JD>,
  "fit_summary": "<one direct sentence — were they actually a fit or not?>",

  ],
  "honest_verdict": "<2-3 sentences: should they keep applying to roles like this with tweaks, or pivot to better-fitting roles? Tell the truth — don't be falsely encouraging.>"
}

Rules:
- Top 3-5 rejection_reasons ranked by severity (high first).
- Top 3-5 fixes — each must be concrete, not "make it better".
- For ATS issues: name the specific keywords from the JD that are missing from the CV.
- For seniority gaps: name specific scope/scale/responsibility differences.
- For weak phrasing: give a before → after example.
- If the CV is genuinely a strong match and the ghosting is likely the JD's fault (ghost job, internal hire, frozen role), say so plainly in honest_verdict.
- Never invent CV facts. If the CV lacks key info to judge fit, say "CV doesn't show X — add it if true".
- Indian context awareness: be sensitive to Indian CV norms (over-listing of skills, weak action verbs, missing impact metrics) but don't assume.
